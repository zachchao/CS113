/**
 * OSPrinter.java
 * 
 * Class Invariant: Not actually multithreaded and does not wait
 * a minute because the program would take a long time to run. 
 * 
 * @author Zachary Chao <zach.chao@yahoo.com>
 * @version 1.0
 * 
 * Algorithm - 
 * The os should delegate printers and jobs
 * The jobs should be first prioritized by size
 * 	- Less than ten is a small job
 * 	- Less than twenty but larger than ten is a medium job
 * 	- Greater than twenty is a large job
 * When two jobs are of an equal size they are prioritized by 
 * the order they are entered
 * This will be done using three queues, one for small jobs
 * one for medium and a last one for large jobs
 * When the OSPrinter is fed an amount of pages to print
 * it will construct the object PrinterJob, this will set 
 * the type in an instance variable
 * The type will be gotten and then the jobw ill be put into
 * its designated queue
