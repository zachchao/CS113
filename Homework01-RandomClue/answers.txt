Theory 1 - Failed - 94575, Succeeded - 5425
Theory 2 - Failed - 94438, Succeeded - 5562
Theory 3 - Failed - 94523, Succeeded - 5477

The difference between theory 1, 2 and 3 is negligible as it is random.
What is good is that the success tends to be 5%.

With my implementation it is 100% success for all theories.
This is good because she is batman now.
